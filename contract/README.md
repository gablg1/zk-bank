First make sure you `yarn` in this folder to install dependencies. To run tests do:

```shell
yarn test
```

To run a local Hardhat blockchain node on port 8545, do:

```shell
npx hardhat node
yarn deploy-local
```

This way you're able to run a local React dApp that connects to our local Node via Metamask or similar.
